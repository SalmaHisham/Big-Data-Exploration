# Big Data Exploration

This repository contains my coursework projects for the Introduction to Big Data course in my Master's degree program to explore and dice into the big data technologies. 

Each project is organized into its own directory, making it easy to navigate and explore. Below is an overview of the included projects.

## Table of Contents

- [Map_Reduce](#https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Intro_Big_data/tree/main/Map_Reduce)
- [docker-Hadoop](#https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Intro_Big_data/tree/main/docker-Hadoop)
- [docker-Hive](#https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Intro_Big_data/tree/main/docker-Hive)
- [docker-Flink](#https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Intro_Big_data/tree/main/docker-Flink)

## Project 1: Map Reduce

The **Map_Reduce** project focuses on implementing basic MapReduce tasks for data preprocessing. Key objectives include filtering and aggregating data using the MapReduce programming model.

It covers:

- Implementation in Python 
- Implementation in Notebook 
- Implementation using Java 

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Java 8 or 11 (Java 9 or 10 may work)

---

## Project 2: Hadoop

Implementing an **inverted index using MapReduce** in Java and running it on a **Docker Hadoop cluster**. Additionally, it explains how to monitor the application using the Resource Manager.


The inverted index is a data structure commonly used in information retrieval systems to quickly find documents that contain specific words. It maps each term to a list of documents in which the term appears. In this project, we'll implement an inverted index using MapReduce, a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel.

It covers:

- Running Hadoop Cluster using Docker Compose
- Job Verbose
- Application Monitoring
- Application Logs using Terminal

### Technologies Used
- Hadoop GitHub Repository: https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop
- Docker
- Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
- Java 8 or 11 (Java 9 or 10 may work)

---

## Project 3: Hive
This is a guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up **Docker Hive** and perform various operations using Hive queries.

It covers:

- Launch the Hive CLI.
- Show databases.
- Create a Hive database.
- Switch to the newly created database.
- Show tables of a database.

### Technologies Used
- Apache-Hive GitHub Repository: https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hive
- Docker
- Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
- Java 8 or 11 (Java 9 or 10 may work)

## Project 3: Flink
This project is a **Flink application** that calculates the session duration for each IP address based on a given dataset. The session duration results are saved to a file for further analysis.

It covers:

- Apache Flink Installation.
- Apache Flink Program Anatomy.
- Running a Flink Job.
- Apache Flink Dashboard UI.
- Complex Example the using DataStream API.

### Technologies Used
- Apache-Flink GitHub Repository: https://github.com/apache/flink
- Docker
- Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
- Git
- Maven (version 3.8.6 is required)
- Java 8 or 11 (Java 9 or 10 may work)
